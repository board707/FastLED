FastLED port for W80x controllers
===========

This is a version of FastLED library for w80x controllers and should be used with w80x_arduino package.

The actual version uses I2s bus as a transport, so you limited to use only one of hardware I2s pins as DIN: **PA0**, **PA10**, **PB11** or **PB14**.

Only WS2811/2812 LED chipsets tested.
